My homework for multithreaded programming course.
All labs were written with MSVS 2015 and used built-in OMP and MSMPI.

Lab work #1 - Count matrix product. Uses OMP.

Lab work #2 - Find inverse matrix. Uses MPI.

Lab work #3 - Hyperquicksort. Uses MPI.

Lab work #4 - Parallel Dijkstra's algorithm. Uses OMP.
